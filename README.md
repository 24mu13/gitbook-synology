# Synology Notes

The content is inspired by the [website](https://mariushosting.com/) of _Marius Bogdan Lixandru_ and its great work, but the main differences and motivations here are the following:
- **Simplicity**: no screenshots for dummies, no long explanations; just essential notes
- **Markdown** based
- **GitOps** inspired
